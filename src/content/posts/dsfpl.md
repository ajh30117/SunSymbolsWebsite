**Design for How People Learn (Voices That Matter)**

Julie Dirkson’s Design for How People Learn is a refreshingly accessible guide on crafting effective learning experiences. Written for both novice and experienced designers, it is an engaging, compact, and comprehensive survey of the fundamental practices any designer should consider when thinking about how to best help people learn. Dirkson combines information and research from the fields of instructional design, psychology, neuroscience and information architecture to support the concepts detailed in each chapter. The book is easy to digest and includes attractive charts, graphs, dialogues and other visual representations to help simplify and reinforce concepts. Dirkson implements the concepts covered by the book in her own writing of it in order to optimize readers’ learning experiences.

I found every chapter to contain valuable information about how people learn. Moreover, I greatly appreciated the way Dirkson wove science and research throughout her explanations of each topic. For instance, in her discussion of learning styles she made sure to point out that while learning styles do play a role in education, the conventional VARK (Visual, Auditory, Reading, Kinesthetic) model is not currently scientifically supported and for the most part, people are better defined by the similarities in how they learn than by the differences.

Below are some of my most valuable takeaways and a few critiques from each chapter. Many of these points I do my best to keep in mind whenever I create learning content.

**Chapter 2**

The discussion of mental models was very useful. How can you best help learners structure information?

**Chapter 3** 

It’s important to define specific learning goals in learning objectives. Use verbs!

Good survey of learning scales (Will Thalheimer taxonomy of learning objectives, Gloria Gery learning scales and Bloom’s taxonomy). Something I found interesting was Dirkson’s synthesis of the Gloria Gery scales and Bloom’s Taxonomy into the X and Y axes of a proficiency graph. 

The concept of “pace layering” was interesting—understand the difference between what progress that learners can make short-term versus long-term, in other words fast and slow skills. Design for either type of skill. Don’t expect learners to be able to change their foundation quickly.

**Chapter 4**

Context-based learning is key. I feel intimately familiar with this knowledge from my forays into language acquisition research as well as being an English speaker living in a non-English speaking country.

The best way to get better at something is to do it. It’s necessary to practice retrieval, not just recognition, in order to be able to retrieve. 

**Chapter 5**

I was happy to see Dirkson acknowledge modern culture of distraction

I was skeptical of her discussion of the “elephant model”—two modules of control in the brain (rider versus elephant or rational versus emotional). This model is potentially controversial. A lot of modern science supports a more fluid conception of rationality & emotion.

Dirkson discussed the impact of the ego on learning—it’s important to make people the heroes of their own stories. This point is widely supported by psychology—humans are very self-focused; they like to be the hero/cast themselves as the hero of their own story already.

Other ways to optimize learning:

* Increase emotional resonance.
* Use social learning—we learn better together.
* Use effective visuals—visuals should help distribute the cognitive load.
* Intrinsic presides over extrinsic motivation. Give learners autonomy.

**Chapter 6**

I disagree with Dirkson’s take on cognitive load. She advises mediating cognitive load, asserting that “aside from the constraints of hunger, fatigue, and bathroom breaks, there’s really no limit on someone’s potential attention span” (173). Modern research on attention span and cognitive load suggests the opposite.

**Chapter 7**

Dirkson explains that learning practice ideally allows learners a balance of challenge and satisfaction (flow/edge between challenge and ability). It is important to allow learners to take breaks and coast occasionally.

**Chapter 8**

This chapter was all about habits. Dirkson included a lot of valuable information, citing prominent research in the field.

**Summary**

My criticisms of “Design for How People Learn” are sparse. The few I do have revolve mostly around some science being ill-founded, out-dated or implemented into the book in a reductive way. The writing also falters at times—there are some proofreading errors and some writing is unclear. This detracts from the author’s message and ethos, but only minorly. 

Ultimately, the book provides a thorough and multi-dimensional survey of the ways we can understand learning and how we can use that information to try to optimize it. Dirkson also mentions several other useful books and resources readers can pursue for further research.

I would also argue that this book is not only for those in the business of learning or curriculum design. As a student and enthusiast of rhetoric and persuasion, I found most of the information applicable to that field as well. Processing, reacting to, and integrating new information is embedded in our daily lives. It is integral to our functioning and development as humans. I think this book is a valuable read for anyone interesting in taking a deeper look at those phenomena.
