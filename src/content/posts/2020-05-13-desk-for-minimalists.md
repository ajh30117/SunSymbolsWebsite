**Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World**

Cal Newport’s “Deep Work” delivers a focused and passionate manifesto on harnessing the power of deep work for personal and professional gain. Newport, an associate professor of computer science at Washington DC’s Georgetown University, stresses how deep work is becoming a rare commodity in the swamp of email, social media, and shallow tasks that so many contemporary “knowledge workers” find themselves stuck in. With the rise of Web 2.0 comes a rise in awareness of the myriad distractions vying for space in today’s attention economy. Thus, the conversation around attention and deep work continues to grow in popularity and relevance. Newport’s rhetoric on this topic is compelling: he deftly bothers readers with images of time, energy, and genius lost to modern mindlessness and makes a sound case for deep work’s scarcity principle. What “Deep Work” fails to do, however, is bolster its urgent claims with convincing and substantive research. Newport attempts to use research to support: 

(1) the value of deep work\
(2) the methods used to accomplish more of it

which is sometimes insightful, but too often feels repetitive and hackneyed. What’s more, Newport’s advice on increasing deep work productivity is too often tailored to the lifestyle and habits of an academic, stunting his ability to resonate with a broader audience. Due to this lack of substantial research and the narrow range, the book’s full effect doesn’t do justice to the intrigue and exigency of its premise. 

Part 1: The Idea

Part 1 is broken into three chapters: “Deep Work is Valuable,” “Deep Work is Rare,” and “Deep Work is Meaningful.” I had already gathered these things from the eighteen-page introduction (hell, maybe even the cover page), in which Newport details--almost excruciatingly--the importance of deep work. I feel a bit redundant even writing this. These chapters could easily be condensed into one. Somewhere in the second chapter I began to sense that I was reading filler --an anxiety unalleviated by the book’s hefty pages, spacious text and generous margins (the book bordered on being downright unwieldy). By the third chapter I’d identified the primary value this book would provide: to bring the issue of deep work to the surface of my consciousness and convince me that I needed to be doing more of it. It was not until Part 2 that I fully realized what the book would not provide: convincing and scientific evidence explaining why deep work was important. . . and how to do it.

Part 2: The Rules

Newport’s methods for accomplishing the goal of producing more deep work were often too arbitrary and personalized to his own livelihood and lifestyle to be adopted (at least effectively) by a wide audience. Many of Newport’s rules seemed mostly to apply to fellow academics with teaching responsibilities and publishing deadlines. The book seemed to target an audience of fellow professors and academics, not the growing masses of “knowledge workers” Newport often references, who have no need to work out mathematical proofs in their heads during morning walks or concern themselves with how to schedule teaching time versus research time per calender year. However, Newport did offer some tips that I found useful. The following are some of those:

be conscious and deliberate about social media consumption
add routine and ritual to your deep work endeavors
use “grand gestures” to leverage inspiration and commitment to a goal
allow leisure time to recharge energy and attention
“embrace boredom” - resist constant distraction (phone, laptop, music) to improve concentration

I thought these were good, actionable pieces advice that I could apply to my own life, but other “rules” were rather out of reach. I remember laughing at Newport’s proposition of a memory exercise that involved walking through five rooms in your home and then perhaps into your backyard. (I live in a modest studio apartment in Southeast Asia and have seen neither hide nor hair of a backyard in months). Combined with generous doses of info on how CEOs handle email, how academics optimize publication rates and of course, Bill Gates, it is moments like that Newport’s connection with his audience potentially falters and some readers may be left wondering if this book is for them.

Additionally, there is entirely too much time devoted to discussing email. I suspect Newport may be a bit deeper in his addiction to email than the majority of his readers. As someone who does not have an addiction to email, I found all the advice on this topic useless and was agitated to see email-talk creep insidiously into every chapter.

I enjoyed Chapter #’s discussion on social media. Contrary to what the chapter’s name suggests, Newport does not promote a point-blank refutation of social media and its potential benefits. Instead, he argues that one should scrutinize their use of each social media platform on the criterion of the value it offers as a tool for achieving personal or professional goals. Emphasis on goals - he completely disregards the use of social media for entertainment, art, or relaxation. 

I was slightly disappointed that Newport didn’t touch at all upon the stealthy al/lure of platforms like Google, Youtube, Instagram, and Facebook --  internet intermediaries who rely on algorithms to draw consumers in, feed them endless loops of content, and completely hijack attention. Here, I think Newport missed an opportunity to help readers weaponize this knowledge and push back against the influence of Web 2.0 monopolies, a threat that only fortifies the hazards of mindless media consumption. 

As a psychology enthusiast, I also would have appreciated more science on boredom, attention training, how constant distraction shapes cognition, and the benefits of meditation (beyond Newport’s personally acclaimed think-walk). However, Newport is a computer scientist--not a neuroscientist--so it’s understandable that much of his advice relies on empirical evidence and popular psychology instead of harder-hitting science. 

tldr: 

After reading this book, I am certainly more conscious of the need to increase my attention capacity and create space for more deep work in my life. I am also totally convinced of the value these efforts can bring to my personal and professional goals. I will not, however, be abiding by most of Newport’s suggested methods to implement these efforts, nor will I be relying heavily on the research cited in his book to better understand the science of attention. While I think most people can benefit from reading this book, I view it as a springboard--not a field guide--for one’s forays into the realm of productivity.
