Hi, I'm Anna. I work as an in-house editor for a publication based in Taipei, Taiwan. Having studied Rhetoric & Professional Writing along with Psychology at the University of Tennessee, I enjoy combining rhetoric and psychology with my writing work to craft clear and compelling communication. 

Rhetoric can be simply defined as the study of symbols. These symbols form systems we use to express ourselves. Language is the most expansive and important of these systems. Therefore, thoughtful and skillful use of language is vital to effectively expressing ideas, connecting with people and impacting opinions.

In addition to writing, rhetoric and psychology, my professional interests include learning design, technical writing and web development/programming.

Are the ideas well-developed and clearly articulated? Are there any flaws in logic? This type may call for adding or removing large amounts of information. It often involves leaving notes and ongoing communication between author/editor. *[Big picture]*

> ## About This Website
>
>SunSymbols was built using Gatsbyâ€”an open-source static website generator based on React. It is hosted on Netlify (which offers cloud hosting and serverless backend services) via continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. The design was customized from a Jamstack template made by [Stackrole](https://stackrole.com/).
>
>I chose to build a static (over dynamic) website for speed, security and cost-efficiency. I used Gatsby and Netlify due to their ample documentation, user support and compatibility with GitHub. Git branching makes it easy for me to edit my source code locally and test it on a development server before deploying the changes to my site. It is also a great tool for collaboration with others developers.
