## A Brief Guide to Types of Editing Projects:

* **Proofreading**: This type focuses on mechanics, including inconsistencies, spelling, grammar, punctuation, capitalization, abbreviation, formatting, etc. *[Writing correctly]*  
<br>

* **Copyediting**: This type is more comprehensive. The editor focuses on word choice, spelling, grammar, mechanics, coherence/cohesiveness, transitions, style, tone,  sentence structure, citations/references and overall writing quality. The editor makes sure your writing is technically correct as well as clear, concise and eloquent. *[Improving the reading experience]*

* **Content/developmental editing**: The editor considers the content/substance of the paper. Is it well-structured? Is the style and tone consistent? Does it flow well? Are the ideas well-developed and clearly articulated? Are there any flaws in logic? This type may call for adding or removing large amounts of information. It often involves leaving notes and ongoing communication between author/editor. *[Big picture]*

> ## About This Website
>
>SunSymbols was built using Gatsbyâ€”an open-source static website generator based on React. It is hosted on Netlify (which offers cloud hosting and serverless backend services) via continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. The design was customized from a Jamstack template made by [Stackrole](https://stackrole.com/).
>
>I chose to build a static (over dynamic) website for speed, security and cost-efficiency. I used Gatsby and Netlify due to their ample documentation, user support and compatibility with GitHub. Git branching makes it easy for me to edit my source code locally and test it on a development server before deploying the changes to my site. It is also a great tool for collaboration with other developers.
