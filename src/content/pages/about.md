I work as an in-house editor for a publication in Taipei, Taiwan. With a BA in English Rhetoric and Professional Writing and a minor in Psychology from the University of Tennessee, I enjoy combining knowledge from my studies in psychology with my writing to craft clear and compelling communication. 

Rhetoric can be simply defined as the study of symbols. These symbols form systems we use to express ourselves. Language is the most expansive and important of these systems. Therefore, thoughtful and skillful use of language is vital to expressing ideas, connecting with people and impacting opinions.

In addition to writing, rhetoric and psychology, my professional interests include learning design, technical writing and web development/programming.

> **About This Website**

>SunSymbols was built using Gatsbyâ€”an open-source static website generator based on React. It is hosted on Netlify (which offers cloud hosting and serverless backend services) via continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. The design was customized from a Jamstack template made by [Stackrole](https://stackrole.com/).

>I chose to build a static (over dynamic) website for speed, security, and cost-efficiency. I used Gatsby and Netlify due to their ample documentation, user support, and compatibility with GitHub. Git branching makes it easy for me to edit my source code locally and test it on a development server before deploying the changes to my site. It is also a great tool for collaboration with others developers.
