Hi, I'm a freelance writer and editor based in Taipei, Taiwan. I enjoy integrating ideas from the fields of rhetoric, psychology, and technology into my work to craft clear and compelling content that exactly meets readers' needs.

My areas of focus include copyediting, editing, and technical writing/editing.

I also have interests in learning design, UI, and web development.
