* **Content/developmental editing**: The editor considers the content/substance of the paper. Is it well-structured? Is the style and tone consistent? Does it flow well? Are the ideas well-developed and clearly articulated? Are there any flaws in logic? This type may call for adding or removing large amounts of information. It often involves leaving notes and ongoing communication between author/editor. *[Big picture]*
