> ## About This Website
>
>I built the SunSymbols website using Gatsbyâ€”an open-source static website generator based on React. It is hosted on Netlify (which offers cloud hosting and serverless backend services) via continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. I customized the design based on a Jamstack template made by [Stackrole](https://stackrole.com/).
>
>I chose to build a static (over dynamic) website for speed, security and cost-efficiency. I used Gatsby and Netlify due to their ample documentation, user support and compatibility with GitHub. Git branching makes it easy for me to edit my source code locally and test it on a development server before deploying the changes to my site. It is also a great tool for collaboration with other developers.
